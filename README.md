# La Fortuna

Back when I was studying at the University of Southampton as part of one module I was gifted a small iPod like device powered by a ATMEL AT90USB1286 microprocessor. It's called the La Ruota Della Fortuna - I call it La Fortuna for short. This repository contains all my messing about with it.

## Requirements

In order to compile code and flash it to the ROM of the La Fortuna you will need the following tools:
- avr-gcc (Complier)
- dfu-programmer (Writes to the board)
